# Camunda RPA Python Libraries

This repository contains two Python libraries.

## Camunda RPA

A re-export of RPAFramework. As RPAFramework is [not maintained as of Feb 15, 2025](https://updates.sema4.ai/release/HHWEX-embracing-python-for-automation-as-code), we ensure Camunda can take over maintenance without disruption to the users by introducing the libraries to the Camunda namespace.

## Camunda Utils

This library offers keywords to interact with Camunda. It allows you to:
git - Set output variables
 - Upload and download documents
